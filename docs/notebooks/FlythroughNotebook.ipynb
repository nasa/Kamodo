    "The ModelFlythough function flies a user-supplied trajectory through the chosen model data. This is the function the other flythrough functions call once a trajectory is acquired. The blocks below demonstrate this by first getting a trajectory from one of the Kamodo trajectory functions - SatelliteTrajectory in this case - and can be done with any of the trajectory functions. See the Trajectory section for more details."
